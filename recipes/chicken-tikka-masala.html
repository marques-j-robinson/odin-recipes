        <li>2 small onions (or 1 large onion) finely diced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons garlic finely grated</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger finely grated</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>14 oz (400g) tomato puree (tomato sauce/Passata)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Kashmiri chili (optional for colour and flavour)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground red chili powder (adjust to your taste preference)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups of heavy or thickened cream (use evaporated milk for lower calories)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water if needed</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons Fresh cilantro or coriander to garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine chicken with all of the ingredients for the chicken marinade; let marinate for 10 minutes to an hour (or overnight if time allows).</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. When sizzling, add chicken pieces in batches of two or three, making sure not to crowd the pan. Fry until browned for only 3 minutes on each side. Set aside and keep warm. (You will finish cooking the chicken in the sauce.)</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in the same pan. Fry the onions until soft (about 3 minutes) while scraping up any browned bits stuck on the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Add garlic and ginger and saut√© for 1 minute until fragrant, then add garam masala, cumin, turmeric and coriander. Fry for about 20 seconds until fragrant, while stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Pour in the tomato puree, chili powders and salt. Let simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally until sauce thickens and becomes a deep brown red colour.</li>
        <li>Stir the cream and sugar through the sauce. Add the chicken and its juices back into the pan and cook for an additional 8-10 minutes until chicken is cooked through and the sauce is thick and bubbling. Pour in the water to thin out the sauce, if needed.</li>
        <li>Garnish with cilantro (coriander) and serve with hot garlic butter rice and fresh homemade Naan bread!</li>
    </ol>
